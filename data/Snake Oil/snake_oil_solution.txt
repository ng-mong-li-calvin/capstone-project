Answer all questions, and remember to give in-depth answers:
1) Take a look at the attached capture file.
Which protocol can you see there?
SSL/TLS

Can you identify the host name of the target server?
www.snakeoil.dom
It's found in packet #6 in one of the entries in the certificate that the server returns to the client.

2) It seems like you need to add a secret ingredient.
Download the other attached file (secret.file), and open it with the document editor of
your choice.
Can you guess what this file is?
Private key file used to decrypt the traffic. It must match the server certificate's public key to work.


3) Add the secret key file to your Wireshark’s key file store.
If you don’t know how to do it, look at Wireshark’s Wiki page on SSL and RSA keys
Now, reload the capture file.
Steps to do it:
1. Edit -> Preferences
2. Select "RSA Keys" from the sidebar menu.
3. Click on "Add new keyfile...", and select the secret file downloaded.
4. Reload Wireshark.

Can you see the real traffic now?
Yes, I see the clean HTTP.

Where did the user try to go, and what did they try to do?
User tried to go to https://localhost/, and received a default Apache page. That page loaded some resources like small images. Some were found, and some weren't.

Then, he tried to go to /test, and got redirecte to /test/. There, a blank page appeared with the string "sdfsdfsdfsdf".
He went to /test2/, and got a blank index of directory page.
Finally, he went to /test3/ and encountered a 404 error.
