 1. Take a look at the attached capture file.
 Which protocol can you see there?
	TCP
 Can you identify the host name of the target server?
	localhost, 127.0.0.1 is a loopback IP address

 2. It seems like you need to add a secret ingredient.
 Download the other attached file (secret.file), and open it with the
 document editor of your choice.

 3. Can you guess what this file is?
	It's an RSA private key based on the RSA algorithm

4. Add the secret key file to your Wireshark’s key file store.
 If you don’t know how to do it, look at Wireshark’s Wiki page on
 SSL and RSA keys
 Now, reload the capture file.
 Can you see the real traffic now?
 Where did the user try to go, and what did they try to do?
	The RSA key's extension file type had to be changed to .key and used as a RSA key within wireshark.
	The user tried to access the following:
	openlogo-25.jpg
	apache_pb.png
	jhe061.png
	favicon.ico
	back.gif
