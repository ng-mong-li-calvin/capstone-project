1) What was the first RFC number for ICMP? What is its current status?

RFC 777, deprecated by RFC0792

6) May a host send ICMP Source Quench Messages? Provide a quote supporting your answer.

In RFC6633 this was changed: "A host MUST NOT send ICMP Source Quench Messages, if a source quench message is received, the IP layer MAY silently discard it."
